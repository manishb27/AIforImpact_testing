- **LangChain**: A framework for building applications with large language models.
- **Vertex AI**: Google Cloud's managed machine learning platform.
- **FireStore**: Backend for the collections that we would use for the product prototype. 

## Goals

- To understand the capabilities of LlamaIndex and LangChain.
- To explore how Vertex AI can be utilized for deploying and managing machine learning models.
- To integrate these technologies into Kisaan Companion to provide valuable insights and assistance to farmers.
